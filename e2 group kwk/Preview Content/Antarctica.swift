Currently, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, or the ocean current circling the continent, is warming faster than the rest of the ocean. As the continent gets warmer and the glaciers melt, the global sea level rises, which is detrimental for low-elevation cities, such as Amsterdam, New Orleans, and Venice. As conditions alter in Antarctica, many forms of wildlife find themselves struggling to survive, leading to drastic population declines and a decrease in biodiversity. ")
