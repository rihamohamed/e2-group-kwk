In fact, the temperature in many parts of Northern Canada is increasing at about 3 times the global rate. This is a direct effect of human-initiated carbon dioxide emissions. This greenhouse gas remains in the Earth's atmosphere and prevents heat from escaping, causing widespread warming. These drastic changes in temperature bring about countless climate events in the country, including wildfires, floods, and extreme heatwaves throughout the summer. ")
